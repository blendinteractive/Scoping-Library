# Banner (Base Page)

Site content page

### Banner

The banner features:â€Œ

* Image (image size/dimensions to be determined in design and followed via editorial tooltip)

There are two options here:

* A smaller "ambiance" that serves as the background for a title
* A "hero" style banner&#x20;

Needs to have a semantic If blank, it manifests as fallback image and uses page

* Header area is page title
* If you add an image that's the image

### Testing Scenario

1. An image should be upload-able and should appear on the front-end when added/changed
2. Page title text should appear on the banner
3. When no image has been uploaded the fallback state should be visible
4. A tooltip or some helper text should be visible to help the editor know what size of image should be used
5. Heading text should always take into account color contrast when an image is and is not present
6. The banner should following the design at all screen sizes
7. Typically the banner should not repeat when the banner area gets larger than the image. If there's an option to choose repeat/don't repeat a checkbox should be available for this functionality.
