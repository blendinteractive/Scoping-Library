# URL Structure and Canonical URLs

### Scope

Every page will have a canonical URL.

In addition to canonical URLs, before we parse a page we'll strip trailing slashes and convert to lowercase.

### URL Structure

Episerver has a standard and we follow that. Anything above this is out of scope.

### Testing Scenario

1. Scan the site to make sure each page has a canonical URL.
