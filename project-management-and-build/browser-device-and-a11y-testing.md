# Browser, Device, and A11y Testing

### Functional Specifications <a href="#functional-specifications" id="functional-specifications"></a>

\[CONTENT IN BRACKETS included for long-term support contracts.]

Blend will test the site for functionality and usability in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari on both Mac and Windows, and the latest version of Edge on Windows. We will also test on both the most recent and most popular version of both Safari for iOS and Chrome for Android.

All versions will be set upon a signed contract \[and reviewed annually], and will be tested using Browserstack.com.

Blend follows an internal set of best practices to enable sites to follow many of the objective guidelines defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Full WCAG compliance cannot be guaranteed by development alone, since it involves subjective measures and page content developed by editors.

During testing, Blend applies a set of objective measures as defined by the WAVE accessibility tool to key test pages on the site for issues that can be addressed in the CMS implementation. In addition, the page will be tested for basic screen reader usability using VoiceOver for Mac.&#x20;

We do not test for items beyond our control, such as editorial content, images, or other editor-driven functionality.
