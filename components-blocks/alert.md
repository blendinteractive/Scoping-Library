# Alert

### Functional Specifications

* Alerts appear when a page is loaded if content is in the admin on every page of the site.
* If dismissed by the user, the alert won't appear again until their next visit (?).

### Considerations

* Should the alert show on all pages or specific pages only?
* What if more than one Alert is present on a page at a time?
* Timed alert dismissal (1 day, 1 week, etc.)
* Should the Alert allow links, images, etc?
* Is the alert set with a start/end date/time or does it stay until removed editorially?

### Testing Scenario

* Can the Alert be navigated using a keyboard? Can it be dismissed using a keyboard?
* Can the Alert be dismissed? Does it stay dismissed for the correct amount of time?
* Does the dismissed timer restart when an alert is removed and a new one is added?
* Does the Alert display correctly in all supported browsers and screen sizes?
