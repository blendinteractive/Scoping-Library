# Carousel (INCOMPLETE)

Carousel content includes cards, images, and other content that rotates either automatically (with a pause button) or manually.

### Considerations

* Does the carousel start and stop or does it start over at the end?
* What happens when the design is 3 items wide but there are only 2 items added?
* The carousel should not allow a key board user to tab to items that are "off screen" so they aren't trapped going through 100 carousel items before they can move on in the page. Next/Previous arrows give them access to navigate the items? Should arrow keys handle this when in the carousel?
