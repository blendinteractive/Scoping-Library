# Expand/Collapse (INCOMPLETE)

A single collapsible area that opens and closes independently of other areas around it.

### Functional Specifications

Individual collapsible areas are activated open or closed by clicking/touching the interaction area - the entire title and expand/collapse icon. When open, the main content area is _not clickable/tappable_ for the interaction.

An individual collapsible area is a unique component that includes a title (heading, which acts as the interaction) and both a rich-text editor and component area. Heading titles can be adjusted based on editorial needs.

### Example

### Testing Scenario

1. Expand/Collapse can only be placed on required pages
2. Title is editable and title appears on the front-end
3. When active (clicked/focus with enter) the Expand/Collapse opens independent of other Expand/Collapse items
4. A focus state is visible when tabbing through Expand/Collapse items
5. Only the scoped content is available to be placed within an Expand/Collapse. Typically this is a WYSIWYG field or media
