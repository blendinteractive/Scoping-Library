# Carousel / Video (INCOMPLETE)

Just add video instead of image

* Need to figure out how to make the video smaller
* Need to provide measurements in the field? Not a great way to do this, but its part of what we need to talk about

NOTE: Requirements: we need to place in the scoping our suggested requirements

* Needs to be verbiage around bit rate and resolution - this is on your plate - "web ready video" of this bit rate and resolution.

With background video vs. video content - background video loops a certain number of times, and then stop ... has to have a play/pause button.

Typically it will loop for a certain amount of and then fade to the fallback image.

Always fallback image for mobile, or for if video does not load.

This is an override block that takes over the banner area.

Needs to include sr-only H1 for when a screen reader is&#x20;

Need to have a semantic H1 in this case separate from a banner

### Carousel

&#x20; Carousel is the container, indicates it's going to rotate

* This does not include total count
* This does not include speed - this is set as something
  * Speed is tuned to amount of content, if it's going to auto-rotate. We usually argue against auto-rotating the slides
* Needs a pause button
  * Still trying to figure out the best way to tab through a carousel
