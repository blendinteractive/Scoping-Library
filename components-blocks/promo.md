# Promo / Promo Card (ADD BUILD/HOURS)

A Promo component image at the top (or to the side) with the rich-text below or alongside, while a Promo Card is a full-width image with the rich-text overlaid (right or left align).

### Functional Specifications

The promo features:

* Image (image size/dimensions to be determined in design and followed via editorial tip)
* Editorial (rich-text) area

The editorial area allows for headings and links to be dropped in freely according to editorial standards. Layout (add as necessary to scope):

a) Image on top with editorial below

b) Image to the left/right with editorial to the opposite side

c) Image full-width with editorial overlaid (and aligned to right or left)

### Additional Functionality

Some projects may want more specialized and structured versions of these, and so this scope will need to be modified to allow for those as dictated by wireframes / design.

### Content Model

* Image upload
* Editorial (rich-text) field&#x20;
