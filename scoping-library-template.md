# Scoping Library Template

{% hint style="info" %}
**INTRODUCTION**: Explain the basics of the component, and explain any variations to that component.
{% endhint %}

A Promo component image at the top (or to the side) with the rich-text below or alongside, while a Promo Card is a full-width image with the rich-text overlaid (right or left align).

### Functional Specifications

{% hint style="info" %}
**FUNCTIONAL SPECS**: What does this component provide. What does a developer need to know to make it work?
{% endhint %}

The promo features:

* Image (image size/dimensions to be determined in design and followed via editorial tip)
* Editorial (rich-text) area

The editorial area allows for headings and links to be dropped in freely according to editorial standards. Layout (add as necessary to scope):

a) Image on top with editorial below

b) Image to the left/right with editorial to the opposite side

c) Image full-width with editorial overlaid (and aligned to right or left)

### Additional Functionality

{% hint style="info" %}
**ADDED FUNCTIONALITY**: Add this as necessary for one-offs or other occasional extras, to be integrated into the scope as necessary.
{% endhint %}

Some projects may want more specialized and structured versions of these, and so this scope will need to be modified to allow for those as dictated by wireframes / design.

### Content Model

{% hint style="info" %}
**CONTENT MODEL**: List all potential fields in component, and include fields that tie to the additional functionality as necessary.
{% endhint %}

* Standard fields
  * Image upload
  * Editorial (rich-text) field&#x20;
* Additional fields
  * Additional field 1
  * Additional field 2

### Estimate Hours
