# Redirects

### Scope

Example:

Blend will implement a redirect system that will integrate into the Episerver admin for basic redirect handling. This system will also include a database-internal table to redirect legacy URLs to new locations. BF Red or APTA will provide a list of pages to redirect prior to launch. The list will be in the form of an Excel table, with one redirect per row, and two columns:

* Old URL
* New URL

### Process

We need to get this early, or before it's too late.
