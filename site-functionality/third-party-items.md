# Third-Party Items

If we're using third-party items, we need to be able to speak to:

* Accessibility issues
* Page weight and performance
* Potential security issues

Potential items where this comes up:

* Share This
* Google Analytics
* Google Maps
* Youtube Embeds
* Google Tag Manager
* External Ad Platforms
* Fonts (FontSquirrel, TypeKit)

These are often tracked in the README.
