# Site Indexing

Information on generating XML sitemap

* We just need to say that we provide an XML sitemap
* Sometimes we may need to require things like last updated time and frequency
  * Roughly how often does this page update
  * We can do this by content type, if necessary.
  * We often don't need to be particular about what we put in here - we just do the standards.

Allow CSS and Javascript to be indexed

Beaconfire asked for this and Joe may have the documentation for what we did and what we do in the future.
