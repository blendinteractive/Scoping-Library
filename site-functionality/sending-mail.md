# Sending Mail

### Scope

For sending mail, we need to know what they're going to use. Blend will use MailTrap (enter in another service, if necessary) to confirm that it's working.

QA should also have mail set up for testing purposes, but we need to make sure we won't accidentally send email to real (production) recipients.
