# Maintenance Page

Scope: This page includes design and content.

Process: We need to talk about this as a part of the front-end process. If your site is down, what things are you required to have out at all times.

\---

For when the site is being updated. Focused on "we know something's not working"

This is a static page

* Example: if it knows the site won't load it loads this page instead.
* This has to be self contained.
* For financial clients - including links to external things
* For hospital - there is contact information on this page

We've done this for Ent and Lurie. We've done something kind of similar for CHCO and Calamos, but both are a disaster relief type of thing.

We can provide suggested verbiage, but we need to put it on them to provide what they want in this specific case. This does not live on the CMS because it shows when the CMS is down.
